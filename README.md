# 🚴‍♂️ London Bike Sharing Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **London bike-sharing data** and presents key insights through an **interactive dashboard**. The data was **preprocessed using Python**, and the dashboard was built using **Tableau**, allowing users to explore trends in bike usage over time and the impact of weather conditions dynamically.  

---

## 📂 Data Preprocessing  
The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed in **Python** before visualization. Key steps included:  
- **Handling missing values** to ensure data consistency  
- **Transforming date and time data** for better time-series analysis  
- **Aggregating ride counts** based on time and weather conditions  
- **Structuring the data** for seamless integration into Tableau

## 📊 Dashboard Features  

### 🔹 Total Bike Rides  
- Displays the **total number of bike rides** for the selected period.  
- Provides an overview of bike usage trends.  

### 🔹 Dynamic Moving Average Trend  
- A **line graph** that visualizes the **moving average of bike rides** over time.  
- **Users can adjust the moving average period dynamically** using a Tableau parameter to analyze short-term or long-term trends.  

### 🔹 Temperature vs. Wind Speed Analysis  
- A **heatmap** showing the relationship between **temperature, wind speed, and bike rides**.  
- Helps in understanding the **impact of weather conditions** on bike usage.  

### 🔹 Interactive Filters  
- **Users can select custom time periods** to analyze specific trends.  
- **Moving average duration is adjustable** via Tableau parameters.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **Python**: Data preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation

## 🎯 Key Insights  
✅ Warmer temperatures generally lead to **higher bike usage**.  
✅ Wind speed affects ridership—**fewer rides occur on extremely windy days**.  
✅ The **dynamic moving average feature** allows users to spot seasonal and long-term trends.
